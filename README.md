Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing annual earnings of American citizens using data analytics. The dataset includes demographic and socioeconomic attributes such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and work hours, which are examined to understand their impact on income distribution and workforce performance.

Objectives
- Understand demographic and socioeconomic factors such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and work hours that influence annual earnings.
- Identify reasons behind income disparities and highlight patterns of high and low earning groups.
- Predict future trends in workforce earnings using statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Suggest data-driven strategies to improve economic equity, workforce planning, and policy-making.

Descriptive Analysis (What happened?) 

• Analysed individuals across age, education, workclass, and income categories. 

• Higher education levels generally align with higher income. 

• Males tend to work longer hours per week than females. 

• Most individuals fall into mid-age groups with moderate working hours. 

Diagnostic Analysis (Why did it happen?) 

• Higher income among educated individuals due to better job opportunities. 

• Longer working hours for males linked to occupational roles and workclass 
distribution. 

• Mid-age groups dominate workforce participation due to career stability. 

• Capital gain/loss concentrated among fewer individuals due to investment patterns. 

Predictive Analysis (What will happen?) 

• Individuals with higher education and longer working hours are more likely to fall 
into higher income categories. 

• Demand for skilled jobs will continue to favor educated groups. 

• Income inequality may persist due to differences in workclass and capital gains. 

• Mid-age individuals will remain the largest workforce segment. 

Prescriptive Analysis (What should be done?) 

• Promote education and skill development to improve income opportunities. 

• Balance work hours across genders by encouraging flexible work policies. 

• Provide financial literacy programs to broaden capital gain opportunities. 

• Tailor workforce policies to support mid-age employees while preparing younger 
groups for career growth.
